    <h1>WEB DESIGN</h1>
    <p>A web designer works on a website's appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content.Appearance relates to the colors, typography, and images used.
    Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.
    A well-designed website is simple and communicates clearly to avoid confusing users. It wins and fosters the target audience's trust, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible.
    Responsive and adaptive design are two common ways to design websites that work well on both desktop and mobile.</p>
